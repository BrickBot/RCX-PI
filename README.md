RCX-PI
======
RCX-PI is an experimental robot platform API. Main target use is to integrate a Raspberry PI with a Lego Mindstorm RCX microcontroller robot.
The plan is to integrate them together with data from a smart-phone's accelerometer and camera to allow seamless remote control and further robotics related development.
